# Kanbangaroo Backend

This is a small backend that accompanies the frontend code discussed part 4 of a series of blog posts on [Neighbourhoodieâ€™s blog](https://neighbourhood.ie/blog/2025/01/15/resource-locking-with-couchdb-and-svelte). Step four is the first step in the series that requires a backend, so the tags in this repo start with `step-4`.

You have currently checked out the code for `step-4`

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Usage

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This will start the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.
